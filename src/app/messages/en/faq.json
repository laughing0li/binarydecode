            "title": "1. What is Binary code system?",
            "step1": "Binary code is a system of representing text or computer processor instructions using the binary code system's two binary digits, 0 and 1. This coding system underlies the operation of all digital computers and many other types of digital systems. In binary code system, each digit within a binary code is referred to as a bit (short for binary digit), which is the smallest unit of data in computing.",
            "step2": "Binary code is more like human language but is for computers. Without binary code, computers would not be able to store data or perform complex calculations."
        },
        "faq2": {
            "title": "2. What is Hexadecimal code system?",
            "step1": "Hexadecimal, often shortened to hex, is a base-16 numeral system. Unlike the decimal system (base-10) which uses 10 digits (0 through 9), the hexadecimal system uses 16 symbols to represent values. It includes the standard decimal digits (0 to 9) and six additional symbols represented by the letters A through F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, C for 12, D for 13, E for 14, and F for 15.",
            "step2": "The decimal code is the most common way to represent numbers, and it is the primary number system used in arithmetic and mathematics."
        },
        "faq3": {
            "title": "3. What is Octal code system?",
            "step1": "The octal code system, or octal code, is a base-8 numeral system that uses eight symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It's a compact representation of binary data, where each octal digit represents three binary digits (bits), making it simpler to read and understand large binary numbers for humans.",
            "step2": "Octal code offers a more human-readable way to interpret binary code, reducing the likelihood of errors in reading or transcribing long sequences of binary code."
        },
        "faq4": {
            "title": "4. What is Binary decode?",
            "step1": "Binary decode refers to the process of converting binary code—data represented in the binary numeral system of 0s and 1s—into other numeric formats (such as decimal, octal, hexadecimal) or into human-readable text. This process is fundamental in computing and digital communications, where binary data needs to be decoded or displayed in a more understandable form for analysis, processing, or interaction."

            "step1": "Using binary 1101 as an example",
            "step2": "Starting from the right (least significant bit), the positions are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 and 2^3",
            "step3": "The binary code `1101` means there's a `1` in the 2^3, 2^2, 2^0 and a `0` in the 2^1",
            "step4": "The far right digit is `1`, so 2^0 X 1 = 1",
            "step5": "Moving left, the next digit is `0`, so 2^1 X 0 = 0",
            "step6": "Then `1` again, so 2^2 X 1 = 4",

            "step1": "Converting binary to hexadecimal involves grouping the binary digits into sets of four (starting from the right) and then converting each group into its hexadecimal equivalent. Hexadecimal is a base-16 system, using digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent values 10 to 15.",
